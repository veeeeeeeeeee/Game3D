Regarding the bullets texture:
 - Toon shader is used
 - Inside the .ps file, I've made a few changes:
    - lightColour now times with 1-fresnal, so the border now has
the texture's colour, inside with black colour
    - in return, value is 1-[the formula] so the black part gets
inverted to white
    - by doing this, I have to use red texture for blue bullets
and vice versa
    - the alpha value in calculating fresnal times with a linear
value so as the point is further away from the border, it gets
blurrier
    - actually glowing outwards would be better than inwards but
this is probably as far as tricks can go
